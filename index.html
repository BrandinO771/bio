  Hello my name is Brandon, I have over 12 years of experience in banking administration, and 5 years designing/programming games. I enjoy working with and supporting teams, with an innate ability to provide support where needed, as well as interact and collaborate with staff, offsite departments, vendors at all levels with tact. I have experience with scheduling and facilitating meetings; travel arrangements, juggling projects, document production and review, assembling presentations, internal auditing, quarterly compliance, budgeting and collaborating with accountants and auditors.  Itâ€™s in my nature to identify problems and visualize different ways of solving them, asking questions is natural for me.  </p> 


 <p style="color:rgb(0, 255, 170);"> 
 I grew up in North County, San Diego and recently returned from the San Francisco area to be closer family. 
I am level headed, polished, easy going, detailed oriented, evaluator of past and present with a future focus. </p>
